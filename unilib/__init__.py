"""
unilib - Uniswap V2/V3/V4 pool reading across EVM chains.

The protocol is the same everywhere; only addresses change. Point it at a chain,
hand it a pool address or a V4 pool id, and ask for prices without caring which
version you are talking to.

    chain = CHAINS[999]                        # HyperEVM
    w3 = chain.connect()

    pool = load_pool(chain, "0x314cAdD6...", w3=w3)
    print(pool.symbol, pool.price())           # HYPURR, price in WHYPE
    print(pool.quote_sell(1000))               # selling 1000 HYPURR -> ? WHYPE
